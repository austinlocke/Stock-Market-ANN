Class project for intro artificial intelligence class. 
Demonstrates a very basic artificial neural network, albeit not a very accurate one.

This was my first 'real' project in Computer Science. It has lots of bad practices which I'm not proud of
included, but was created without any real guide other than the basic model of how a neural network is created.

I've learned that this type of ANN isn't really suitable for stock market prediction, but it
was fun regardless. It uses one input layer, one hidden layer, and the final output node is the predicted price
of that given stock.
